# Periodic-Table-Word-Finder



## About

**Periodic-Table-Word-Finder** is a simple and fun web app that allows you to explore the periodic table in a unique way: by attempting to spell words using the symbols of chemical elements! Challenge yourself and see how many words you can form using the symbols from the periodic table.

## How It Works

- **Enter a Word**: Type in any word you can think of.
- **Spell with Elements**: The app will try to spell your word using the symbols of the elements. For example, "COFFEE" can be spelled using **C** (Carbon), **O** (Oxygen), **Fe** (Iron), and **E** (if it existed).
- **Results Displayed**: If your word can be spelled using element symbols, the app will display each element with its **atomic number**, **symbol**, and **name**.

## Features

- **Interactive Learning**: Learn about the elements while you play. Each element in your word will show its atomic details.
- **Fun & Educational**: Discover the periodic table in an engaging way by forming everyday words.
- **Simple Design**: The app is lightweight and easy to use, with a clean interface to make spelling with the periodic table fun and accessible for everyone.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML & CSS**: For building a simple and responsive UI.
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: Implements all the core logic, including user interaction and word validation.
- **JSON**: Stores periodic table data for efficient lookup and processing.

## Examples

- **Word: "CUTE"**

  - **Elements Used**: **C** (Carbon), **U** (Uranium), **Te** (Tellurium)
  - **Output**:
    - C: Carbon (Atomic Number 6)
    - U: Uranium (Atomic Number 92)
    - Te: Tellurium (Atomic Number 52)

- **Word: "BANANA"**

  - **Elements Used**: **B** (Boron), **A** (if it existed), **Na** (Sodium)
  - **Output**: Unfortunately, "BANANA" cannot be fully spelled with current element symbolsÂ Try It Out!
